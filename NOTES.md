- controlled mutations vs immutability
- no way to intercept actions
- mutation can be intercepted only after it has happened
- html binding instead of pure refactorable js
- actions names and getter names as strings instead of pure functions
- multiple incopatible ways to dispatch actions/mutations (action creators are needed)
- undocumented behavior mapMutations/mapActions (we can also pass a function)
- intercepting mutations from other features
- namespaces creates more problems than it solves
   - unique names for getter
   - actions and mutations can be sloved by unique TYPES but not getters
   - creating dispatchable mutations/actions in plugins
- nice module composition + grouping all state utils
